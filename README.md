# Bank_Loan_Sales_Analysis
## Description
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of a financial institution's loan portfolio, highlighting loan applications, funded amounts, payments received, interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. It includes month-to-date (MTD), previous month-to-date (PMTD), and month-over-month (MOM) metrics, enabling analysis of lending trends. The dataset also categorizes loans by term, purpose, borrower's homeownership status, and state-wise distribution.
## Objective
The goal is to create two interactive dashboards:
1.	Summary Dashboard - Offers a high-level view of key performance indicators (KPIs) and loan status.
2.	Overview Dashboard - Delves into detailed trends, regional analysis, and loan characteristics to support data-driven decisions.
## Project Highlights
