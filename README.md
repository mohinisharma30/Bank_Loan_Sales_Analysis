# Bank_Loan_Sales_Analysis
## Description
This dataset provides a comprehensive overview of a financial institution's loan portfolio, highlighting loan applications, funded amounts, payments received, interest rates, and debt-to-income (DTI) ratios. It includes month-to-date (MTD), previous month-to-date (PMTD), and month-over-month (MOM) metrics, enabling analysis of lending trends. The dataset also categorizes loans by term, purpose, borrower's homeownership status, and state-wise distribution.
## Objective
The goal is to create two interactive dashboards:
1.	Summary Dashboard - Offers a high-level view of key performance indicators (KPIs) and loan status.
2.	Overview Dashboard - Delves into detailed trends, regional analysis, and loan characteristics to support data-driven decisions.
## Project Highlights

Expand offerings in debt consolidation and credit card refinancing, as these are the most common loan purposes.

**3.**	**Portfolio Optimization**:-
Prioritize loans for borrowers with strong credit histories, as they have better repayment performance.

Focus on 36-month loans as they are more popular and have shorter-term risk exposure.

**4.**	**Performance Monitoring**:-
Track MTD, PMTD, and MOM metrics to quickly detect issues and take action.

Regularly update dashboards to maintain visibility into trends and performance.

**5.**	**Dashboard Improvements**:-
Add interactive filters for "Loan Purpose," "State," and "Term" to allow dynamic analysis.

Include predictive analytics to forecast bad loan rates and support proactive decision-making.

By implementing these recommendations, the institution can reduce risk, boost operational efficiency, and improve profitability. The dashboards offer a clear and concise view of loan performance, helping stakeholders make data-driven decisions.
